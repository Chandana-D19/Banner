# Banner
I have designed a dynamic and responsive banner using JSX, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. The banner is built as a reusable React component, ensuring modularity and flexibility. It utilizes CSS for styling, animations, and responsiveness, making it visually appealing across different screen sizes. The banner seamlessly integrates within a React application, enhancing the UI with interactive and modern design elements.
